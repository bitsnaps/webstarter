# WebStarter

This is a simple GUI app allows you to automatically start your web and DB servers, then open a web app on your localhost with a single click without running any annoying console.

Tested on Windows x64 with XAMPP server (apache & mysql) and it should work with other servers and other OS (code may need to be adapted), you just need to update the ini file (default example values are created by the app).

Changelog:
- 01-03-2021: Initial release (1.0.0).
